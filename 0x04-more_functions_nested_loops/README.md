# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, learners should be able to explain:

### General
- What nested loops are and how to utilize them.
- The concept of a function and its usage.
- The distinction between a function's declaration and definition.
- What a function prototype is.
- The scope of variables in C.
- The purpose and usage of gcc flags: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- The role of header files and how to incorporate them using `#include`.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Each file should end with a newline.
- `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project directory.
- Coding style should adhere to the Betty style. This will be verified using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are prohibited.
- A maximum of 5 functions per file is allowed.
- Usage of standard library functions such as `printf`, `puts`, etc. is forbidden.
- You can use the `_putchar` function.
- There's no need to push `_putchar.c`. It won't be considered as we will use our own.
- While main.c files are provided as examples for testing your functions, they don't need to be pushed. Our `main.c` files might differ from the provided examples and will be used during compilation.
- All function prototypes, including the prototype for `_putchar`, must be included in the header file named `main.h`.
- Ensure to push your header file.
