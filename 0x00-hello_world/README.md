## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Explain why C programming is awesome.
- Identify the inventors of C and notable figures like Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Describe the process when you type `gcc main.c`.
- Understand entry points and the `main` function.
- Use `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` for text output.
- Use the `sizeof` unary operator to determine type sizes.
- Compile using `gcc`.
- Recognize the default program name with `gcc`.
- Adhere to the official C coding style and check code with `betty-style`.
- Determine the appropriate header for standard library functions in source code.
- Understand how the `main` function affects program return value.
