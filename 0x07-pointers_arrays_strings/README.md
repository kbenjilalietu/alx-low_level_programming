# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain the following without needing to reference external sources:

### General

- Understand and explain what pointers to pointers are and how to use them.
- Understand and explain what multidimensional arrays are and how to use them.
- Recognize and describe the most common C standard library functions used for string manipulation.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Compilation:**
  - All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
  - Code will be compiled using the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
- Coding style should follow the Betty style guidelines. The style will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- The use of the standard library is prohibited. This means functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden.
- Usage of the function `_putchar` is permitted.
- There's no need to push `_putchar.c` as it will be provided during compilation. If pushed, it will not be considered.
- While provided `main.c` files can be used to test your functions, you should not push them. During the grading process, different `main.c` files may be used.
- Ensure all function prototypes, including that of `_putchar`, are included in a header file named `main.h`.
- Lastly, don't forget to push your header file.
