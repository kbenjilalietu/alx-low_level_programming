# 0x02. C - Functions, Nested Loops

In this project, we'll delve deep into the world of C programming, focusing on understanding and using functions and nested loops.

## Resources

**Read or Watch**:
- [Nested while loops](#)
- [C - Functions](#)
- [Learning to Program in C (Part 06)](#) *(stop at 14:00)*
- [What is the purpose of a function prototype?](#)
- [C - Header Files](#) *(stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

### General

- What nested loops are and how to use them.
- The concept and utilization of functions in C.
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function.
- The significance of a function prototype.
- Understanding the scope of variables.
- The purpose of gcc flags: `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`.
- The role of header files and their inclusion with `#include`.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Compilation will be done on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `gcc` with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Every file should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project directory.
- All code should adhere to the [Betty style](#). They will be verified using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No global variables are permitted.
- A maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Using the standard library and its functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`) is prohibited.
- `_putchar` function is allowed for usage.
- There's no need to push `_putchar.c`. Our own file will be used during checking. Pushing it won't affect the evaluation.
- Though `main.c` files are provided as examples, you don’t have to push them. We will use our own versions for compilation, which might differ from the provided samples.
- Ensure all function prototypes, including that of `_putchar`, are present in the `main.h` header file.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
