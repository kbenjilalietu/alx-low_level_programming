# 0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you delve deeper into the programming world and embark on a career as an industry engineer, you will get acquainted with advanced debugging tools such as gdb, as well as the built-in tools that various IDEs offer. Nevertheless, it's fundamental to grasp the underlying concepts and manual processes of debugging.

## Learning Objectives

By the conclusion of this project, you should be proficient enough to elucidate the following concepts without resorting to Google:

### General

- **What is debugging?**
    - Debugging refers to the comprehensive process of detecting, diagnosing, and resolving errors, bugs, or abnormalities in software that deter it from functioning as intended.

- **What are some methods of debugging manually?**
    - *Manually inspecting code:* This involves a line-by-line check of the code to identify any potential issues.
    - *Print-based debugging:* Using print statements at various code points to understand the flow and values of variables.
    - *Rubber duck debugging:* The process of explaining your code or the problem you're facing to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object). This method leverages the idea that speaking out loud can help solve problems.

- **How to read the error messages?**
    - Error messages typically provide a hint or direct information about where the error occurred (file name, line number) and the nature of the error (syntax, type, runtime, etc.). Understanding these components can assist developers in quickly locating and addressing the issue.

*For best results, always approach debugging with patience and a systematic mindset. Each bug resolved is a step closer to a functional application.*
