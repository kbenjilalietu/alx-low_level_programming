# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project dives deep into the concept of recursion in C programming. It aims to educate on the principles, applications, and best practices surrounding recursive functions.

## Learning Objectives

**General**
- Understand what recursion is.
- Learn how to implement recursion.
- Ascertain when to use and when not to use recursion.

## Requirements

1. **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs.
2. **Compilation:**  
   - All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
   - Compilation flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
3. All files must end with a newline.
4. A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
5. Coding style: Betty style. Code will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
6. Global variables are forbidden.
7. Max of 5 functions per file.
8. The use of standard library or functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc is prohibited.
9. Only `_putchar` function is permitted.
10. Don't push `_putchar.c`. It won't be considered for the project. Our own file will be used for evaluation.
11. While `main.c` files might be provided as examples, you don't have to push them. They might differ during the evaluation.
12. All function prototypes and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should reside in the header file named `main.h`.
13. Always push the header file.
14. Loops of any form are forbidden.
15. Usage of static variables is prohibited.
