# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to explain:

### General

- What are pointers and how to use them.
- What are arrays and how to use them.
- The differences between pointers and arrays.
- How to use and manipulate strings.
- Scope of variables.

### General

- **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **gcc** with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a newline.
- Your code should adhere to the [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki). It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No global variables are allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You can't use the standard library. Usage of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc is forbidden.
- Only `_putchar` is allowed for output.
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, it will be provided during compilation. If pushed, it won’t be considered.
- The `main.c` files in the examples are just for illustration. You may use them, but they won't be considered during grading.
- All function prototypes should be included in a header file named `main.h`.
- Always push your header file.
