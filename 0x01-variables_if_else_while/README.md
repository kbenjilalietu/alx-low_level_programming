# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project delves into the basics of C programming, covering essential topics such as variables, conditional statements, loops, and more. By the end of the project, participants will have a firm grasp of foundational C programming concepts.

**Manuals or Help Commands:**
- `ascii` (*Note: No need to dive into topics like `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, for loops, do...while loops, functions at this point.*)

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to:

**General**
- Describe and utilize arithmetic operators in C.
- Understand and apply logical operators in C.
- Know the relational operators in C and their applications.
- Distinguish between TRUE and FALSE values in C.
- Utilize boolean operators in C.
- Implement `if` and `if ... else` statements in C.
- Write and understand comments in C.
- Declare and initialize variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`.
- Assign values to variables in C.
- Print the values of variables using `printf`.
- Implement and understand the `while` loop in C.
- Use variables within the `while` loop in C.
- Understand and explain the ASCII character set.
- Understand the purpose of the gcc flags `-m32` and `-m64`.
