# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students should be able to:

### General

- Understand what pointers are and how to use them.
- Understand what arrays are and how to use them.
- Recognize the differences between pointers and arrays.
- Know how to use strings and manipulate them.
- Understand the scope of variables.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Code compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- No usage of the standard library. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc are forbidden.
- Usage of `_putchar` is allowed.
- `_putchar.c` does not need to be pushed. A different external file will be used during compilation.
- Sample `main.c` files are provided in examples but they need not be pushed. Different files may be used for compilation.
- Prototypes of all functions and `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`.
- The `main.h` file should be pushed to the repository.

## More Info

This project delves deeper into the use of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. Through the tasks, students will reinforce their knowledge and understanding of these concepts, preparing them for more advanced topics in the language.
